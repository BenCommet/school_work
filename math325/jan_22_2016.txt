- countably infinite unionn of countably infinite sets is countably infinite
	# go thorugh them diagonally

-algebraic number - zero of some polynomial with integer coeffecients
	# rational -> x = p/q =>qx - p
	# root -> sqrt(a) = x^2 - a
	* The set of algebraic numbers is countably infinite
		#PROOF there are countably many degree n polynomials with integer coefficients.
		Each has at most n roots. Thus there are countably many roots for each n, and overall.
		This means there are countable n's with countable roots meaning the algebraic numbers are countable
		EX: p(x) = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D

-The open interval (0,1) is uncountable?
	PROOF BY CONTRADICTION
	Assume (0,1) is countable, list elements then if ya can in nonterminating decimal form
	x1 = .x11x12x13....
	x2 = .x21x22x23...
	x3 = .x31x32x33...

	construct a decial not on the list.
	let d =.d1d2d3d4...
	d1 change x11, d2 change x22, d3 change x33.....
	
	construct a decimal not on the list. Let d = .d1d2d3..... with dn={if!=1+ 2 else = 1} now d differs form each xi, so it isn't on the list
	thus(0,1) is uncountable

-fancy(R) has a 1-1 correspondence with (0,1) via y = tan(piX - pi/2)
	so |R| = (0,1)
	(X^3 graph)
	
-Transcendental number
	#real, not algebraic though
	ex: pi and e are tanscendental
	The tanscendental numbers are uncountable
		(if not, the reals (union of trancendentals are real algebraic numbers) would be countable.)

-Shroder_Bernstein Theorem
	if |A| <= |B| and |A| >= |B| Then |A| == |B|
	Idea: There are 1-1 functions f:A->K and g:B->A. Construct a sequence by alternation functions. 
	#Three Cases:
		A....................
		B....................
	1. link diagonally starting horizontally at a
	2. same but with b
	3. loop back
	use them to construct bijection
	
	Map(X,Y) = (.x1x2x3x4...., .y1y2y3y4
	to .x1...
	Thus |R| = |R^2|
